<blockquote>
  <p>WordCamp is <strong>a conference that focuses on everything <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/">WordPress</a></strong>. WordCamps are informal, community-organized events that are put together by WordPress users like you! Everyone from casual users to core developers participate, share ideas, and get to know each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WordCamp US is the annual meetup held (as the name suggests) in the US! There are also huge conferences for <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/">WordCamp Europe</a> and <a href="https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023/">WordCamp Asia</a>, as well as 100s of regional WordCamp events around the globe.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-wordcamp">What to expect from WordCamp:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Networking opportunities</li>
  <li>Guided Workshops</li>
  <li>Discussion panels</li>
  <li>Informative talks</li>
  <li>Swag, prizes, and after-hour parties!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-ride-out-">The Ride Out <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/2708.svg" alt="✈️" /></h2>

<p>For many of our in-person attendees, their WordCamp experience started in their local airport. We had XWPeople attend from Australia, Germany, and all over the US.</p>

<p><img src="https://xwp.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_3380-scaled.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://xwp.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_7688-scaled.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://xwp.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_6733-scaled.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>But with WordCamp US being such an exclusive event this year, much of our attendance came from our team of XWPeople around the world! Our team joined the fun remotely through Twitter and the official Livestream.</p>

<h2 id="xwp-team-day-surfs-up-">XWP Team Day: Surf’s Up <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f3c4-200d-2640-fe0f.svg" alt="🏄‍♀️" /></h2>

<p>Before we got into the craziness of WordCamp, our team took to the waves for a day of surfing and Mexican food to catch up, relax, and enjoy some time in the sun.</p>

<p><img src="https://xwp.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_7004-2-scaled.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="wordcamp-swag-">WordCamp Swag <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f455.svg" alt="👕" /></h2>

<p>Anyone who’s attended an in-person WordCamp knows how amazing the swag can be. This time, we came along with our always-popular event tees and the coolest Astroperson coozies to keep everyone’s drinks cool in the San Diego sun.</p>

<p><img src="https://xwp.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/FcZWhOsWYAAFiEd-768x1024.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>But of course, we weren’t the only ones with goodies to share. Here’s a glimpse of some of the other amazing swag brought along by WCUS attendees:</p>

<h2 id="party-on-the-bay-">Party on the Bay   <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f6f3.svg" alt="🛳" /></h2>

<p>That evening, a few of us also caught up with our friends at <a href="https://pagely.com/">Pagely</a> to take in some views of the San Diego bay!</p>

<h2 id="day-1-highlights-">Day 1 Highlights <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f64c.svg" alt="🙌" /></h2>

<p>Opening day kicked off as attendees checked in and scoped out the sponsor booths (including all that free swag we mentioned <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f609.svg" alt="😉" />) and <a href="https://atlantawpcoach.com/">Kathy Drewien</a> opened the event with opening remarks, reminding us all how to be together in person again.</p>

<p>The arena was split into two talk tracks—the Sun track and the Palm track. You can find the footage from both stages along with timestamps for each talk below. All thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWQnu9XpK3ze10STZv9ORLg">WordCamp Central</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://xwp.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Fb-6o1XoAAPag4.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Our Senior Engineer &amp; Architect Alain Schlesser kicked off the workshop track by giving a beginner’s guide to WP-CLI (in front of a jam-packed audience ready to learn).</p>

<p>If you’re new to WP-CLI, it’s the command line interface for WordPress. A text-based tool that allows you to control WordPress at scale. It is useful for local development, for remote control of your servers, and for automating menial &amp; not so menial tasks.</p>

<p>Alain ran through the basics of WP-CLI before diving deeper to understand how you can remotely control multiple servers with the push of a few keystrokes and how you can progress from manual tasks to fully automated scripts that let you shave minutes, or even hours, off of repetitive tasks.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are no recordings of the workshop track (<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f622.svg" alt="😢" />) but you can find Alain’s slides on his Github: <a href="https://schlessera.github.io/wcus-2022/#/">https://schlessera.github.io/wcus-2022/#/</a></p>

<p>Day two was buzzing with excitement as attendees were treated to a huge range of talks, covering everything from design and commerce to sensitivity.</p>

<p><img src="https://xwp.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/FcEWOmRXoAwJVpZ-1.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>On day 2, we had our fabulous WordPress Engineer Milana Cap take the stage for her talk “WordPress through the Terminal”</p>

<p>Remember the famous “5 minutes installation” process for installing WordPress? In Milana’s talk, she showed what the powerful WP-CLI that Alain introduced in his talk can do in 5 minutes—and everything else that can happen in the terminal in 40 minutes.</p>

<p>This wasn’t your usual presentation talk. It was a live terminal commanding and SSHing your WordPress administration and development, with plenty of jokes, cookies, and releasing a Kraken (or two).</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/r6qRI6xtAXY?t=18864">Check out Milana’s full talk with this handy timestamp.</a></p>

<p>One of the main events of any WordCamp is undoubtedly the live Q&amp;A session with <a href="https://ma.tt/">Matt Mullenweg</a>, the creator of WordPress and CEO of Automattic.</p>

<p>At the larger WordCamps Matt live-answers questions from the crowd, giving the community a chance to get answers to some of their burning questions. You can watch the full session in the video to see how Matt responded to thee following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Can we get support from Meta to get ways to collaborate across teams in a more systematic way?” — <a href="https://twitter.com/DjevaLoperka">@DjevaLoperka</a></li>
  <li>“What is the vision behind <a href="https://t.co/0AcLvhpZVw">WordPress.com</a> to provide more control and provide a better experience than Squarespace &amp; Wix?” — <a href="https://twitter.com/WilliamBay">@WilliamBay</a></li>
  <li>“Why is multi-language support the last priority in the Gutenberg phases?” – <a href="https://twitter.com/mhanes">@mhanes</a></li>
  <li>“Could there be a toggle to install <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hashtag_click">#WordPress</a> in classic mode so we don’t need to remember to install the Classic Editor?”</li>
  <li>“Given we have no timeframe for multilingual support, can we have an alternative for the <a href="https://t.co/9PnfWICyZr">learn.wordpress.org</a> platform?” – <a href="https://twitter.com/courtneyr_dev">@courtneyr_dev</a></li>
  <li>“What is the future of blogging?”- <a href="https://twitter.com/NathanBWeller">@NathanBWeller</a></li>
  <li>“This community is so loving! But how can we be more intentional about providing access and fighting poverty?” – <a href="https://twitter.com/CRDimpact">@CRDimpact</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We even heard from the man himself over on Twitter, after he revealed some of his secret online aliases <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f575.svg" alt="🕵️" /></p>

<h2 id="contributor-day-">Contributor Day <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f4a1.svg" alt="💡" /></h2>

<p>This year’s contributor day was HUGE, with more new faces than ever learning about how they can get involved in the WordPress project.</p>
