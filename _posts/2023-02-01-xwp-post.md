If you‚Äôve been following us for a while you‚Äôll already know how much we LOVE WordCamp events‚Äî but if you‚Äôre new, let us quickly run down what they are:

> WordCamp is¬†**a conference that focuses on everything [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/about/)**. WordCamps are informal, community-organized events that are put together by WordPress users like you! Everyone from casual users to core developers participate, share ideas, and get to know each other.

WordCamp US is the annual meetup held (as the name suggests) in the US! There are also huge conferences for [WordCamp Europe](https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/) and [WordCamp Asia](https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023/), as well as 100s of regional WordCamp events around the globe.

### What to expect from WordCamp:

*   Networking opportunities
*   Guided Workshops
*   Discussion panels
*   Informative talks
*   Swag, prizes, and after-hour parties!

The Ride Out ![‚úàÔ∏è](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/2708.svg)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

For many of our in-person attendees, their WordCamp experience started in their local airport. We had XWPeople attend from Australia, Germany, and all over the US.

But with WordCamp US being such an exclusive event this year, much of our attendance came from our team of XWPeople around the world! Our team joined the fun remotely through Twitter and the official Livestream.

XWP Team Day: Surf‚Äôs Up ![üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f3c4-200d-2640-fe0f.svg)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before we got into the craziness of WordCamp, our team took to the waves for a day of surfing and Mexican food to catch up, relax, and enjoy some time in the sun.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyone who‚Äôs attended an in-person WordCamp knows how amazing the swag can be. This time, we came along with our always-popular event tees and the coolest Astroperson coozies to keep everyone‚Äôs drinks cool in the San Diego sun.

Opening day kicked off as attendees checked in and scoped out the sponsor booths (including all that free swag we mentioned ![üòâ](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f609.svg)) and [Kathy Drewien](https://atlantawpcoach.com/) opened the event with opening remarks, reminding us all how to be together in person again.

The arena was split into two talk tracks‚Äîthe Sun track and the Palm track. You can find the footage from both stages along with timestamps for each talk below. All thanks to [WordCamp Central](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWQnu9XpK3ze10STZv9ORLg).

### XWP Workshops: Getting Started with WP-CLI: Alain Schlesser

![](https://xwp.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Fb-6o1XoAAPag4.jpeg)

Our Senior Engineer & Architect Alain Schlesser kicked off the workshop track by giving a beginner‚Äôs guide to WP-CLI (in front of a jam-packed audience ready to learn).  
  
If you‚Äôre new to WP-CLI, it‚Äôs the command line interface for WordPress. A text-based tool that allows you to control WordPress at scale. It is useful for local development, for remote control of your servers, and for automating menial & not so menial tasks.

Alain ran through the basics of WP-CLI before diving deeper to understand how you can remotely control multiple servers with the push of a few keystrokes and how you can progress from manual tasks to fully automated scripts that let you shave minutes, or even hours, off of repetitive tasks.  
  
Unfortunately, there are no recordings of the workshop track (![üò¢](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f622.svg)) but you can find Alain‚Äôs slides on his Github: [https://schlessera.github.io/wcus-2022/#/](https://schlessera.github.io/wcus-2022/#/)

### XWP Talks: Through The Terminal With Milana Cap

![](https://xwp.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/FcEWOmRXoAwJVpZ-1.jpeg)

On day 2, we had our fabulous WordPress Engineer Milana Cap take the stage for her talk ‚ÄúWordPress through the Terminal‚Äù

Remember the famous ‚Äú5 minutes installation‚Äù process for installing WordPress? In Milana‚Äôs talk, she showed what the powerful WP-CLI that Alain introduced in his talk can do in 5 minutes‚Äîand everything else that can happen in the terminal in 40 minutes.  
  
This wasn‚Äôt your usual presentation talk. It was a live terminal commanding and SSHing your WordPress administration and development, with plenty of jokes, cookies, and releasing a Kraken (or two).

At the larger WordCamps Matt live-answers questions from the crowd, giving the community a chance to get answers to some of their burning questions. You can watch the full session in the video to see how Matt responded to thee following questions:
